# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-OpenCV-in-Python-
The purpose of this project is to create a tool that identifies whether a person is wearing a mask. During these COVID 19 pandemic times, wearing a face mask has become an important element of our daily lives to stay safe. Wearing face masks is required in order to socialize or conduct business. So, this application utilizes a camera to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. The Python libraries I used in this project are OpenCV, Numpy,Matplotlib and sklearn. I also used haar cascade for face detection which extracts persons face, eyes, smile, profile face, upper body from both still images and videos.
